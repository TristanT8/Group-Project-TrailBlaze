Ibrahim - aug 20- 3am

created map controller and model, renamed trailblaze schema to trailblaze
added map_id to markers in schema (think it will be simpler this way)
updated requirements.txt
pushed to main and closed the branch

Ibrahim - aug 20- 2pm

moved flask_app and server.py up in the folder directory because i think theyre supposed to live in the main directory
put the project log and project proposal into trailblaze folder- let me know if you guys disagree with the decision.

Ibrahim - aug20- 2:13pm

put an 'env-trailblaze' folder into the main directory; this way when we start working on the project we just have to type 'source env-trailblaze/bin/activate' in terminal to start the virtual environment. 
updated requirements.txt accordingly, you can install all of the dependencies by typing 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in the terminal after getting into the virtual env. 
changed the default port to 8000 since we have 2 mac users, make sure you go to localhost:8000 after you run the server
